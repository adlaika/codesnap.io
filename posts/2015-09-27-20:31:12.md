So you want to build a URL shortener? Before we write a single line of code, let's design it:

###The Problem

When designing software, the first thing we should ask is: what problem are we trying to solve? In the case of a URL shortener, we're trying to create a way for people to turn long, cumbersome links like this:

https://th.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%B9%82%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%87%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%99%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%8D%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%B9%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%A8_%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%A8%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%98%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%8A

(that's what happens when you encode Thai into Unicode, apparently.)

...into something more manageable, like this:

http://tinyurl.com/olv7ezm

Essentially, we're going to create key-value pairs, like this:

`{ 'olv7ezm' : (that very long wikipedia URL) }`

When a client requests http://tinyurl.com/olv7ezm, we'll parse out the text after the '.com/' and look it up in the database, then redirect to that value. Easy!

But how?

###The Core
Now that we've isolated our problem, it's good to think about what the core mechanic of the application will be. What are we optimizing for? The most important aspect of a good URL shortener is that it provides the shortest url possible.

So: how can we get a shortURL to use as the key in our database? Off the top of my head, I can think of a few ways:

- hash a given URL and grab the first x characters
- get a random series of characters of x length
- use an id that increments once for every new entry

The first two might work for awhile, but they both suffer from the same problem: being random, they'll eventually introduce conflicts, which we'll have to resolve by either increasing the length of the produced shortURL, or by deleting old entries. 

By comparison, the incrementation method will never produce conflicts and scales itself automatically by adding another place. However, it only uses the digits 0-9, meaning it's not a very efficient use of the available characters that can go into a URL string. For instance, with base10, we can only store 10 shortURLS using one place (0, 1, 2, etc.), or 100 with two places. 

Luckily, JavaScript's .toString() method takes a radix from 2-36 that allows us to easily change bases. For instance:

`(1234567890).toString(36) -> 'kf12oi'`

A shortURL that would have taken 10 characters to represent, shown in only 6. Magic!

(If you wanted to REALLY optimize for shortURL length, you could build your own base converter that uses more than just base36's 0-9 and a-z, but you run [certain risks](https://perishablepress.com/stop-using-unsafe-characters-in-urls/), and you're introducing another thing that could fail. I think using toString represents a good trade-off between shortURL size and developer time.)

Now that we've got the core mechanism of the app down, let's think about how we'll store that data.

###The Database
We're looking for a fast key-value store. Sounds like [Redis!](http://redis.io/) Redis runs totally in memory, so it's very, very fast. It's also easy to use. Done. 

Next: how will the client access the data / add new links?

###The Client
Because this is such a simple app, we're going to use Express to render HTML on the server and send it to the client. No need for a hefty framework like Angular. 

That HTML will consist of:

- a form with  field in which to post long URLs
- a field that will show the shortURL our app spits out

...and that's it! Simple, right?

###The Server
Node, with Express on top, is the de-facto standard for backend JS. So that's what we'll use.

##The Big Picture
Here's a diagram of how our app will look:

In the next installment, we'll use Mocha and Should to write tests that will further inform our design and give us the security of knowing exactly when we break something.
